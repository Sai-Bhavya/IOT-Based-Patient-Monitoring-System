Patient monitoring is a pivotal part of the health care system nowadays, either at hospitals or at home. This paper proposes an intelligent patient monitoring system that automatically screens the patient's health condition through various sensors. The data is then processed using a Raspberry Pi and useful information is saved to the IoT cloud. Primarily the system would be extracting the bio signal, ECG using an ECG sensor. Through continuous monitoring and graphical representation of the patient's information, doctors/nurses/relatives can remotely check the patient's condition. Furthermore, if the condition becomes critical, a notification is sent to the doctor/nurse/relative to inform them and either party will have the opportunity to start a video call.
